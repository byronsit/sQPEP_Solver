Authors: Bohuan Xue, Yilong Zhu, Tianyu Liu, Jin Wu, Jianhao Jiao, Yi Jiang, Zhijian He and Chengxi Zhang

The corresponding paper is currently under review. Detailed information and the full paper will be shared once the review process is complete.

# How to use?
see/run opensource_pTop.m directly! It is expected to work well across most versions of MATLAB.

# Why Is There Limited Code Available?
Additional code and utilities will be made available if our paper can be published. Detailed information and the full paper will be shared once the review process is complete.

(Though it may be a bit cumbersome, the example code should be sufficient to show how to convert your scale-QPEP to our framework, allowing them to be solved using the solver.)
