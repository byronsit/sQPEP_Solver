The corresponding paper is currently under review. Detailed information and the full paper will be shared once the review process is complete.

# How to use?
see/run opensource_pTop.m directly! It is expected to work well across most versions of MATLAB.

# Why isn't there any other code?
More useful code will be open sourced after the paper is accepted.
(虽然麻烦了一些，根据示例的代码应该能完成大多数7DOF问题的转化成sQPEP，从而用我们的模板求解了。)




# Why Is There Limited Code Available?
Additional code and utilities will be made available upon the acceptance of our corresponding paper, which is currently under review. Detailed information and the full paper will be shared once the review process is complete.

(Though it may be a bit cumbersome, the example code should be sufficient to show how to convert your scale-QPEP to our framework, allowing them to be solved using the solver.)
