The corresponding paper is currently under review. Detailed information and the full paper will be shared once the review process is complete.

# How to use?
see/run opensource_pTop.m directly! It is expected to work well across most versions of MATLAB.

Though it may be a bit cumbersome, the example code should be sufficient to show how to convert your scale-QPEP to our framework, allowing them to be solved using the solver.
